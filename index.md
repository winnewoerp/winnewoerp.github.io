It seems that Pingu doesn't want to be shown here (I searched a lot for CC images and didn't find any on Wikipedia.org, which is an indicator for me that there is a strong copyright on showing original images). So this picture only shows what he looks like in an approximate way. Picture License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/.
